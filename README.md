# consolidation5-UserContactsApp

This project correstponds to day 60 and 61 from the course 100 Days of Swift UI.

Day 60: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/5/3/challenge
Day 61: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61
JSON file: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json

Objective:
Upon startup the app will fetch a JSON file from the web and decode it. It will then write the data to the CoreData database. The view will read the data from CoreData and display it in a sort of nice way (I did put effort into this). 

Learning Purpose:
Practice fetching files from web, decoding JSON, reading and writing to CoreData, building nice UI.
